<H1>Competition</H1>
<p>
The BlackJack competition involves playing many games of IBM VIE Blackjack. Each game starts with
an initial amount of money, and a set of {@linkplain com.ibm.vie.blackjack.player.TableRules
rules}.
</p>
<p>
Many rounds of blackjack are played in a game. In each round, the player makes an initial wager
and then attempts to create one or more hands that are better than the dealer's hand. If at the
end of the round, the player's hand is better than the dealer's hand, the hand wins.
</p>
<p>
During game play, a player has the option of
{@linkplain com.ibm.vie.blackjack.player.PlayerDecision#SPLIT splitting} a hand into two hands.
This option means that a round will potentially have more than one hand playing against a single
dealer's hand.
</p>
<p>
After all rounds have completed, the game is over and the final amount of available money is the
player's score. The winnings from one game are <b>not</b> carried over to the next game in the
competition.
</p>
<p>
The overall competition winner will be selected from the results of all games played.
</p>

<H1>Winning</H1> A player wins a hand in the following ways:
<ul>
<li>A score of 21 is dealt on the first two cards (called Blackjack) without a dealer blackjack.
A Blackjack wins more than the player's initial bet.
For the competition a 2 to 1 rate is always used. On a blackjack, the dealer returns the bet paid, plus the smallest integer greater than or equal to
the rate multiplied by the bet. For example if the bet is 2 and the player gets a blackjack,
the player is paid the initial bet ($2) + 2 * the initial bet ($4) or $6 (a profit of $4).</li> 
<li>The player's final score is higher than the dealer, without exceeding 21.</li>
<li>The score of the dealer's hand exceeds 21, and the player's hand does not exceed 21</li>
</ul>
<H1>Ties</H1>
<p>
If a player hand is tied with the dealer's hand, and the player hand does not exceed 21 points,
the bet for the hand is "pushed" back to the player. The player traditionally neither wins or loses on that hand.
Although a tie normally does not win or lose money, in our game the dealer will award the player a profit of %50 of the 
bet for the hand. If the player bets $4 and ties, then the player is awarded $6, for a profit of $2.
</p>
<H1>Player Busts</H1>
<p>
If the score of a player's hand exceeds 21, the player's hand loses. The dealer does not play unless there
is at least one player hand that has not busted. In the event that both the dealer and the player hands both exceed 21,
the player's hand loses.
</p>
<H1>Hand Values</H1>
<ul>
<li>Aces may be scored as either 1 or 11</li>
<li>Cards of rank ten, jack, queen, and king are scored as 10</li>
<li>All other cards are scored based on their rank</li>
</ul>

<H1>Player Decisions</H1> The player can take one of four actions on the current hand per turn:
<UL>
<LI><B>Hit</B> Take another card</LI>
<LI><B>Stand</B> Do not take another card, the dealer will compete against the current hand "as
is"</LI>
<LI><B>Double</B> Doubles the bet and takes exact one more card. This decision is only valid when
there are two cards in the hand.</LI>
<LI><B>Split</B> Splits a hand into two hands (Paying the current bet for the extra hand). This
decision is only valid when there are two cards in the hand and both cards are of the same rank.
The player will have opportunities to take actions on both of the new hands.</LI>
</UL>

<H1>Overview and Basic Strategy</H1>
<p>
A more complete general overview of the game can be found on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack">Wikipedia</a>. Our VIE version of the game has
some slightly more relaxed rules than many casinos. These rules should make it easier (but not
necessarily easy) for the player to beat the house.
</p>

<H1>Classes and Interfaces</H1>
<p>
Your challenge is to improve upon the {@link student.player.MyPlayer} strategy that IBM has
provided as a started solution. You'll find many great comments in that class that will
give you some ideas for implementing a solution. 
</p>
<p>
There are a number of interfaces and classes that your strategy will use to interact with the
Blackjack framework. These classes are defined in the {@link com.ibm.vie.blackjack.player} package,
and you should refer to the documentation of that package to see what these classes are and how 
they work.
</p>

<H1>Game Flow</H1> An instance of your {@link com.ibm.vie.blackjack.player.PlayerStrategy
PlayerStrategy} class is created at the start of the game, the same instance is used for the
entire game. During a game, the framework will iterate playing rounds of blackjack using the
strategy. For each round:
<OL>
<LI>An initial bet is obtained by calling
{@link com.ibm.vie.blackjack.player.PlayerStrategy#placeInitialBet
PlayerStrategy#placeInitialBet}</LI>
<LI>The player's initial hand is dealt, followed by the dealer's initial hand. The dealer's
initial hand has only one card that is visible to the player (face up).</LI>
<LI>If either the dealer or player has blackjack, then the outcome is already decided and no
decisions can be made. If neither the dealer nor the player has blackjack the player will use
your strategy to decide what to do:
<OL>
<LI>A {@link com.ibm.vie.blackjack.player.PlayerDecision PlayerDecision} is obtained for the
current hand by calling {@link com.ibm.vie.blackjack.player.PlayerStrategy#decideHowToPlayHand
PlayerStrategy#decideHowToPlayHand}.
<ul>
<li>Decisions made by the strategy result in dealing more cards, adjusting bets, and splitting
hands as appropriate.</li>
<li>Repeated calls to <code>decideHowToPlayHand</code> continue until all player decisions for
all hands have been applied.

A hand is "complete" when any of the following is true:
<UL>
<LI>The maximum number of points equals 21 (aces count as either 1 or 11)</LI>
<LI>The minimum number of points exceeds 21 (aces count as 1)</LI>
<LI>A Stand decision has been made on the hand</LI>
<LI>A Double Down decision has been made on the hand</LI>
</UL>

</li>
</ul>
</LI>
<LI>The dealer's turn begins when all player decisions have been made for all player hands.
<ul>
<li>If every player hand is a bust, then the dealer does <B>not</B> play.</li>
<li>Otherwise, the dealer <b>must</b> hit until a score of at least 17 is reached.</li>
</ul>
</LI>
</OL>
</LI>
<LI>At the conclusion of the round, the available money is updated considering all bets and
outcomes.</LI>
<LI>{@link com.ibm.vie.blackjack.player.PlayerStrategy#decideToWalkAway
PlayerStrategy#decideToWalkAway} is called to decide whether the player plays another round.</LI>
<LI>The cards on the table are cleared and placed in the discard tray</LI>
</OL>


<H1>Deck</H1>
<p>
The number of decks in use will vary between games of the competition. The number of decks in use
for the current game will not change and can be obtained by using the
{@link com.ibm.vie.blackjack.player.GameInfo#getNumberOfDecks() GameInfo#getNumberOfDecks}
method.
</p>
<p>
The deck of cards is shuffled when a card needs to be drawn, and there are no cards available. In
this scenario, only the cards in the discard tray are shuffled into the deck. Cards on the table
remain on the table and will be placed in the discard tray after the end of the round.
</p>



<H1>Game End</H1> The game is over when any of the following occur
<UL>
<LI>{@link com.ibm.vie.blackjack.player.PlayerStrategy#decideToWalkAway
PlayerStrategy#decideToWalkAway} returns true</LI>
<LI>The player has played the maximum number of rounds as specified by
{@link com.ibm.vie.blackjack.player.GameInfo#getMaxNumRounds GameInfo#getMaxNumRounds}</LI>
<LI>The player no longer has sufficient available money to cover the minimum bet as specified by
{@link com.ibm.vie.blackjack.player.GameInfo#getMinBet GameInfo#getMinBet}</LI>
<LI>An exception is thrown from a method in the
{@link com.ibm.vie.blackjack.player.PlayerStrategy PlayerStrategy}, or {@link com.ibm.vie.blackjack.player.PlayerStrategy#decideHowToPlayHand decideHowToPlayHand} 
returns an illegal decision. If this occurs, any bets in progress are awarded to the house.</LI>
</UL>

<H1>Competition End</H1> The competition ends when all games have finished. The outcome of a
single game will not impact whether or not future games are played.


<H1>Additional Rules</H1>
<P>
Some strategies for playing Blackjack are dependent on a few rules and behaviors that have not
been discussed. These ideas may or may not be important, depending on the solution.
</p>
<UL>
<LI>See {@link com.ibm.vie.blackjack.player.CasinoRules#getDealerHitsOnSoft17
TableRules#getDealerHitsOnSoft17} for rules concerning the dealer's ability to hit on "soft
17". In the competition, the dealer will NOT hit on soft 17.</LI>
<LI>See {@linkplain com.ibm.vie.blackjack.player.CasinoRules#getDeckPenetration
TableRules#getDeckPenetration} for rules concerning shuffling a deck at the end of a round.
instead of waiting until a shuffle is necessary to draw a card. In the competition, the deck is shuffled only when absolutely
 necessary.</LI>
